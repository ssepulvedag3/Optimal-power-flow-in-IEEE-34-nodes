# Optimal-power-flow-in-IEEE-34-nodes
This repository contains the OPF for the modified monophase IEEE-34 nodes, the convex approximations are Linear, Second Order Cone and Semidefinite Programming, some DGs has been added. They are solved using CvxPy and ECOS. Furthermore, the exact model is solved making use of Pyomo and Ipopt.
